WinFsp User Mode API.

In order to use the WinFsp API the user mode file system must include <winfsp/winfsp.h>
and link with the winfsp$$_$$x64.dll (or winfsp$$_$$x86.dll) library.

== File System

A user mode file system is a program that uses the WinFsp API to expose a file system to
Windows. The user mode file system must implement the operations in FSP$$_$$FILE$$_$$SYSTEM$$_$$INTERFACE,
create a file system object using FspFileSystemCreate and start its dispatcher using
FspFileSystemStartDispatcher. At that point it will start receiving file system requests on the
FSP$$_$$FILE$$_$$SYSTEM$$_$$INTERFACE operations.

=== Classes

*FSP$$_$$FILE$$_$$SYSTEM$$_$$INTERFACE* - File system interface.

*Discussion*

The operations in this interface must be implemented by the user mode
file system. Not all operations need be implemented. For example,
a user mode file system that does not wish to support reparse points,
need not implement the reparse point operations.

Most of the operations accept a FileContext parameter. This parameter
has different meanings depending on the value of the FSP$$_$$FSCTL$$_$$VOLUME$$_$$PARAMS
flags UmFileContextIsUserContext2 and UmFileContextIsFullContext.

There are three cases to consider:

- When both of these flags are unset (default), the FileContext parameter
represents the file node. The file node is a void pointer (or an integer
that can fit in a pointer) that is used to uniquely identify an open file.
Opening the same file name should always yield the same file node value
for as long as the file with that name remains open anywhere in the system.


- When the UmFileContextIsUserContext2 is set, the FileContext parameter
represents the file descriptor. The file descriptor is a void pointer (or
an integer that can fit in a pointer) that is used to identify an open
instance of a file. Opening the same file name may yield a different file
descriptor.


- When the UmFileContextIsFullContext is set, the FileContext parameter
is a pointer to a FSP$$_$$FSCTL$$_$$TRANSACT$$_$$FULL$$_$$CONTEXT. This allows a user mode
file system to access the low-level UserContext and UserContext2 values.
The UserContext is used to store the file node and the UserContext2 is
used to store the file descriptor for an open file.

==== Member Functions

*CanDelete* - Determine whether a file or directory can be deleted.

[source,c]
----
NTSTATUS ( *CanDelete)(
    FSP_FILE_SYSTEM *FileSystem, 
    PVOID FileContext,
    PWSTR FileName);  
----

*Parameters*

- _FileSystem_ - The file system on which this request is posted.
- _FileContext_ - The file context of the file or directory to test for deletion.
- _FileName_ - The name of the file or directory to test for deletion.

*Return Value*

STATUS$$_$$SUCCESS or error code.

*Discussion*

This function tests whether a file or directory can be safely deleted. This function does
not need to perform access checks, but may performs tasks such as check for empty
directories, etc.

This function should *NEVER* delete the file or directory in question. Deletion should
happen during Cleanup with the FspCleanupDelete flag set.

This function gets called when Win32 API's such as DeleteFile or RemoveDirectory are used.
It does not get called when a file or directory is opened with FILE$$_$$DELETE$$_$$ON$$_$$CLOSE.

*See Also*

- Cleanup


*Cleanup* - Cleanup a file.

[source,c]
----
VOID ( *Cleanup)(
    FSP_FILE_SYSTEM *FileSystem, 
    PVOID FileContext,
    PWSTR FileName,
    ULONG Flags);  
----

*Parameters*

- _FileSystem_ - The file system on which this request is posted.
- _FileContext_ - The file context of the file or directory to cleanup.
- _FileName_ - The name of the file or directory to cleanup. Sent only when a Delete is requested.
- _Flags_ - These flags determine whether the file was modified and whether to delete the file.

*Discussion*

When CreateFile is used to open or create a file the kernel creates a kernel mode file
object (type FILE$$_$$OBJECT) and a handle for it, which it returns to user-mode. The handle may
be duplicated (using DuplicateHandle), but all duplicate handles always refer to the same
file object. When all handles for a particular file object get closed (using CloseHandle)
the system sends a Cleanup request to the file system.

There will be a Cleanup operation for every Create or Open operation posted to the user mode
file system. However the Cleanup operation is *not* the final close operation on a file.
The file system must be ready to receive additional operations until close time. This is true
even when the file is being deleted!

The Flags parameter contains information about the cleanup operation:

- FspCleanupDelete -
An important function of the Cleanup operation is to complete a delete operation. Deleting
a file or directory in Windows is a three-stage process where the file is first opened, then
tested to see if the delete can proceed and if the answer is positive the file is then
deleted during Cleanup.

When this flag is set, this is the last outstanding cleanup for this particular file node.


- FspCleanupSetAllocationSize -
The NTFS and FAT file systems reset a file's allocation size when they receive the last
outstanding cleanup for a particular file node. User mode file systems that implement
allocation size and wish to duplicate the NTFS and FAT behavior can use this flag.


- FspCleanupSetArchiveBit -
File systems that support the archive bit should set the file node's archive bit when this
flag is set.


- FspCleanupSetLastAccessTime, FspCleanupSetLastWriteTime, FspCleanupSetChangeTime - File
systems should set the corresponding file time when each one of these flags is set. Note that
updating the last access time is expensive and a file system may choose to not implement it.



There is no way to report failure of this operation. This is a Windows limitation.

As an optimization a file system may specify the FSP$$_$$FSCTL$$_$$VOLUME$$_$$PARAMS $$::$$
PostCleanupWhenModifiedOnly flag. In this case the FSD will only post Cleanup requests when
the file was modified/deleted.

----

*Parameters*

- _FileSystem_ - The file system on which this request is posted.
- _FileName_ - The name of the file or directory to be created.
- _CreateOptions_ - Create options for this request. This parameter has the same meaning as the
CreateOptions parameter of the NtCreateFile API. User mode file systems should typically
only be concerned with the flag FILE$$_$$DIRECTORY$$_$$FILE, which is an instruction to create a
directory rather than a file. Some file systems may also want to pay attention to the
FILE$$_$$NO$$_$$INTERMEDIATE$$_$$BUFFERING and FILE$$_$$WRITE$$_$$THROUGH flags, although these are
typically handled by the FSD component.
- _GrantedAccess_ - Determines the specific access rights that have been granted for this request. Upon
receiving this call all access checks have been performed and the user mode file system
need not perform any additional checks. However this parameter may be useful to a user
mode file system; for example the WinFsp-FUSE layer uses this parameter to determine
which flags to use in its POSIX open() call.
- _FileAttributes_ - File attributes to apply to the newly created file or directory.

*Parameters*

- _FileSystem_ - The file system on which this request is posted.
- _FileName_ - The name of the file or directory to be opened.
- _CreateOptions_ - Create options for this request. This parameter has the same meaning as the
CreateOptions parameter of the NtCreateFile API. User mode file systems typically
do not need to do anything special with respect to this parameter. Some file systems may

The kernel mode FSD provides certain guarantees prior to posting a rename operation:

- A file cannot be renamed if a file with the same name exists and has open handles.


- A directory cannot be renamed if it or any of its subdirectories contains a file that
has open handles.


*ResolveReparsePoints* - Resolve reparse points.

[source,c]
----
NTSTATUS ( *ResolveReparsePoints)(

Pointer to the buffer size. On input it contains the size of the buffer.
On output it will contain the actual size of data copied.

*Return Value*

STATUS$$_$$REPARSE or error code.

*Discussion*

Reparse points are a general mechanism for attaching special behavior to files.
A file or directory can contain a reparse point. A reparse point is data that has
special meaning to the file system, Windows or user applications. For example, NTFS
and Windows use reparse points to implement symbolic links. As another example,
a particular file system may use reparse points to emulate UNIX FIFO's.

This function is expected to resolve as many reparse points as possible. If a reparse
point is encountered that is not understood by the file system further reparse point
resolution should stop; the reparse point data should be returned to the FSD with status
STATUS$$_$$REPARSE/reparse-tag. If a reparse point (symbolic link) is encountered that is
understood by the file system but points outside it, the reparse point should be
resolved, but further reparse point resolution should stop; the resolved file name
should be returned to the FSD with status STATUS$$_$$REPARSE/IO$$_$$REPARSE.

time should not be changed.
- _LastAccessTime_ - Last access time to apply to the file or directory. If the value 0 is sent, the last
access time should not be changed.
- _LastWriteTime_ - Last write time to apply to the file or directory. If the value 0 is sent, the last
write time should not be changed.

- _SetAllocationSize_ - If TRUE, then the allocation size is being set. if FALSE, then the file size is being set.
- _FileInfo_ - [out]
Pointer to a structure that will receive the file information on successful return
from this call. This information includes file attributes, file times, etc.

*Return Value*

STATUS$$_$$SUCCESS or error code.

*Discussion*

This function is used to change a file's sizes. Windows file systems maintain two kinds
of sizes: the file size is where the End Of File (EOF) is, and the allocation size is the
actual size that a file takes up on the "disk".

The rules regarding file/allocation size are:

- Allocation size must always be aligned to the allocation unit boundary. The allocation
unit is the product `(UINT64)SectorSize $$*$$ (UINT64)SectorsPerAllocationUnit` from
the FSP$$_$$FSCTL$$_$$VOLUME$$_$$PARAMS structure. The FSD will always send properly aligned allocation
sizes when setting the allocation size.


- Allocation size is always greater or equal to the file size.


- A file size of more than the current allocation size will also extend the allocation
size to the next allocation unit boundary.


- An allocation size of less than the current file size should also truncate the current
file size.

Given a file name this function returns an index to the first path component that is a reparse
point. The function will call the supplied GetReparsePointByName function for every path
component until it finds a reparse point or the whole path is processed.

This is a helper for implementing the GetSecurityByName operation in file systems
that support reparse points.

- GetSecurityByName


*FspFileSystemGetOpenFileInfo* - Get open information buffer.

[source,c]
----
static inline FSP_FSCTL_OPEN_FILE_INFO *FspFileSystemGetOpenFileInfo(
    FSP_FSCTL_FILE_INFO *FileInfo) 
----

*Parameters*

- _FileInfo_ - The FileInfo parameter as passed to Create or Open operation.

*Return Value*

A pointer to the open information buffer for this Create or Open operation.

*Discussion*

This is a helper for implementing the Create and Open operations. It cannot be used with
any other operations.

The FileInfo parameter to Create and Open is typed as pointer to FSP$$_$$FSCTL$$_$$FILE$$_$$INFO. The
true type of this parameter is pointer to FSP$$_$$FSCTL$$_$$OPEN$$_$$FILE$$_$$INFO. This simple function
converts from one type to the other.

The FSP$$_$$FSCTL$$_$$OPEN$$_$$FILE$$_$$INFO type contains a FSP$$_$$FSCTL$$_$$FILE$$_$$INFO as well as the fields
NormalizedName and NormalizedNameSize. These fields can be used for file name normalization.
File name normalization is used to ensure that the FSD and the OS know the correct case
of a newly opened file name.

For case-sensitive file systems this functionality should be ignored. The FSD will always
assume that the normalized file name is the same as the file name used to open the file.

For case-insensitive file systems this functionality may be ignored. In this case the FSD
will assume that the normalized file name is the upper case version of the file name used
to open the file. The file system will work correctly and the only way an application will
be able to tell that the file system does not preserve case in normalized file names is by
issuing a GetFinalPathNameByHandle API call (or NtQueryInformationFile with
FileNameInformation/FileNormalizedNameInformation).

For case-insensitive file systems this functionality may also be used. In this case the
user mode file system may use the NormalizedName and NormalizedNameSize parameters to
report to the FSD the normalized file name. It should be noted that the normalized file
name may only differ in case from the file name used to open the file. The NormalizedName
field will point to a buffer that can receive the normalized file name. The
NormalizedNameSize field will contain the size of the normalized file name buffer. On
completion of the Create or Open operation it should contain the actual size of the
normalized file name copied into the normalized file name buffer. The normalized file name
should not contain a terminating zero.

- Create
- Open


*FspFileSystemGetOperationContext* - Get the current operation context.

[source,c]
----
FSP_API FSP_FILE_SYSTEM_OPERATION_CONTEXT *FspFileSystemGetOperationContext(
    VOID);  
----

*Return Value*

The current operation context.

*Discussion*

This function may be used only when servicing one of the FSP$$_$$FILE$$_$$SYSTEM$$_$$INTERFACE operations.
The current operation context is stored in thread local storage. It allows access to the
Request and Response associated with this operation.

use the next available drive letter counting downwards from Z: as its mount point.

*Return Value*

STATUS$$_$$SUCCESS or error code.


*FspFileSystemRemoveMountPoint* - Remove the mount point for a file system.

[source,c]
----
FSP_API VOID FspFileSystemRemoveMountPoint(
    FSP_FILE_SYSTEM *FileSystem);

    UINT32 ReparsePointIndex,
    BOOLEAN ResolveLastPathComponent, 
    PIO_STATUS_BLOCK PIoStatus,
    PVOID Buffer,
    PSIZE_T PSize);  
----

*Parameters*

- _FileSystem_ - The file system object.
- _GetReparsePointByName_ - Pointer to function that can retrieve reparse point information by name. The function
should return STATUS$$_$$SUCCESS if the passed FileName is a reparse point or
STATUS$$_$$NOT$$_$$A$$_$$REPARSE$$_$$POINT (or other error code) otherwise.
- _Context_ - User context to supply to GetReparsePointByName.
- _FileName_ - The name of the file or directory to have its reparse points resolved.
- _ReparsePointIndex_ - The index of the first reparse point within FileName.
- _ResolveLastPathComponent_ - If FALSE, the last path component of FileName should not be resolved, even
if it is a reparse point that can be resolved. If TRUE, all path components
should be resolved if possible.
- _PIoStatus_ - Pointer to storage that will receive the status to return to the FSD. When
this function succeeds it must set PIoStatus->Status to STATUS$$_$$REPARSE and
PIoStatus->Information to either IO$$_$$REPARSE or the reparse tag.
- _Buffer_ - Pointer to a buffer that will receive the resolved file name (IO$$_$$REPARSE) or
reparse data (reparse tag). If the function returns a file name, it should
not be NULL terminated.
- _PSize_ - [in,out]
Pointer to the buffer size. On input it contains the size of the buffer.
On output it will contain the actual size of data copied.

*Return Value*

STATUS$$_$$REPARSE or error code.

*Discussion*

Given a file name (and an index where to start resolving) this function will attempt to
resolve as many reparse points as possible. The function will call the supplied
GetReparsePointByName function for every path component until it resolves the reparse points
or the whole path is processed.

This is a helper for implementing the ResolveReparsePoints operation in file systems
that support reparse points.

*FspFileSystemSendResponse* - Send a response to the FSD.

[source,c]
----
FSP_API VOID FspFileSystemSendResponse(
    FSP_FILE_SYSTEM *FileSystem, 
    FSP_FSCTL_TRANSACT_RSP *Response);  
----

*Parameters*

- _FileSystem_ - The file system object.
- _Response_ - The response buffer.

*Discussion*

This call is not required when the user mode file system performs synchronous processing of
requests. It is possible however for the following FSP$$_$$FILE$$_$$SYSTEM$$_$$INTERFACE operations to be
processed asynchronously:

- Read


- Write


- ReadDirectory



These operations are allowed to return STATUS$$_$$PENDING to postpone sending a response to the FSD.
At a later time the file system can use FspFileSystemSendResponse to send the response.


*FspFileSystemSetMountPoint* - Set the mount point for a file system.

[source,c]
----
FSP_API NTSTATUS FspFileSystemSetMountPoint(
    FSP_FILE_SYSTEM *FileSystem,
    PWSTR MountPoint);  
----

*Parameters*

- _FileSystem_ - The file system object.
- _MountPoint_ - The mount point for the new file system. A value of NULL means that the file system should
use the next available drive letter counting downwards from Z: as its mount point.

*Return Value*

STATUS$$_$$SUCCESS or error code.

*Discussion*

This function supports drive letters (X:) or directories as mount points:

- Drive letters: Refer to the documentation of the DefineDosDevice Windows API
to better understand how they are created.


- Directories: They can be used as mount points for disk based file systems. They cannot
be used for network file systems. This is a limitation that Windows imposes on junctions.


*FspFileSystemSetOperationGuardStrategy* - Set file system locking strategy.

[source,c]

    ULONG ThreadCount);  
----

*Parameters*

- _FileSystem_ - The file system object.
- _ThreadCount_ - The number of threads for the file system dispatcher. A value of 0 will create a default
number of threads and should be chosen in most cases.

*Return Value*

STATUS$$_$$SUCCESS or error code.

*Discussion*

The file system dispatcher is used to dispatch operations posted by the FSD to the user mode
file system. Once this call starts executing the user mode file system will start receiving
file system requests from the kernel.


*FspFileSystemStopDispatcher* - Stop the file system dispatcher.

[source,c]
----
FSP_API VOID FspFileSystemStopDispatcher(
    FSP_FILE_SYSTEM *FileSystem);

    PSECURITY_DESCRIPTOR *PSecurityDescriptor);  
----

*Parameters*

- _InputDescriptor_ - The input security descriptor to be modified.
- _SecurityInformation_ - Describes what parts of the InputDescriptor should be modified. This should contain
the same value passed to the SetSecurity SecurityInformation parameter.
- _ModificationDescriptor_ - Describes the modifications to apply to the InputDescriptor. This should contain
the same value passed to the SetSecurity ModificationDescriptor parameter.
- _PSecurityDescriptor_ - [out]
Pointer to a memory location that will receive the resulting security descriptor.
This security descriptor can be later freed using FspDeleteSecurityDescriptor.

*Return Value*

STATUS$$_$$SUCCESS or error code.

----

*Discussion*

Two concurrency models are provided:

1. A fine-grained concurrency model where file system NAMESPACE accesses
are guarded using an exclusive-shared (read-write) lock. File I/O is not
guarded and concurrent reads/writes/etc. are possible. [Note that the FSD
will still apply an exclusive-shared lock PER INDIVIDUAL FILE, but it will
not limit I/O operations for different files.]
The fine-grained concurrency model applies the exclusive-shared lock as
follows:

- EXCL: SetVolumeLabel, Flush(Volume),
Create, Cleanup(Delete), SetInformation(Rename)


- SHRD: GetVolumeInfo, Open, SetInformation(Disposition), ReadDirectory


- NONE: all other operations



2. A coarse-grained concurrency model where all file system accesses are
guarded by a mutually exclusive lock.

that API's documentation for details on the format specification.

*Discussion*

This function can be used to log an arbitrary message to the Windows Event Log or to the current
console if running in user interactive mode.


*FspServiceLoop* - Run a service main loop.

[source,c]
----
FSP_API NTSTATUS FspServiceLoop(
    FSP_SERVICE *Service);  
----

*Parameters*

- _Service_ - The service object.

*Return Value*

STATUS$$_$$SUCCESS or error code.

*Discussion*

This function starts and runs a service. It executes the Windows StartServiceCtrlDispatcher API
to connect the service process to the Service Control Manager. If the Service Control Manager is
not available (and console mode is allowed) it will enter console mode.


*FspServiceRequestTime* - Request additional time from the Service Control Manager.

- _Service_ - The service object.
- _Time_ - Additional time (in milliseconds).

*Discussion*

This API should be used during Start and Stop operations only.


*FspServiceRunEx* - Run a service.

[source,c]
----
FSP_API ULONG FspServiceRunEx(
    PWSTR ServiceName, 
    FSP_SERVICE_START *OnStart,

*Discussion*

This function wraps calls to FspServiceCreate, FspServiceLoop and FspServiceDelete to create,
run and delete a service. It is intended to be used from a service's main/wmain function.

This function runs a service with console mode allowed.


*FspServiceSetExitCode* - Set the service process exit code.

[source,c]
----
FSP_API VOID FspServiceSetExitCode(
    FSP_SERVICE *Service,
    ULONG ExitCode);  
----

*Parameters*

- _Service_ - The service object.
- _ExitCode_ - Service process exit code.


*FspServiceStop* - Stops a running service.

[source,c]
----
FSP_API VOID FspServiceStop(
    FSP_SERVICE *Service);  
----

*Parameters*

- _Service_ - The service object.

*Return Value*

STATUS$$_$$SUCCESS or error code.
