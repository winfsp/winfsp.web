Developing file systems is a challenging proposition. Developing file systems for Windows is an order of magnitude more difficult. WinFsp eases the task of writing a new file system for Windows. WinFsp file systems are user mode programs and they can be written in a variety of languages and frameworks.

The documentation available here discusses various aspects of WinFsp.

## Programming

- The [Tutorial](WinFsp-Tutorial) describes how to create a simple, but complete file system in C/C++.
- The [API Reference](WinFsp-API-winfsp.h) describes the native WinFsp API. This external [link](http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/apiref/) may be easier to browse for some people.
- There is also a FUSE compatibility layer for native Windows and Cygwin. See fuse.h in the source repository.
- This [document](Native-API-vs-FUSE) discusses the need for both a native API and FUSE and gives some pointers on which one to choose.
- Since release 2019.3 WinFsp supports development of file systems in kernel mode. This [document](WinFsp-Kernel-Mode-File-Systems) discusses how to write such file systems.

## Design

- The [Design](WinFsp-Design) document describes the high-level design of WinFsp.
- The [IPC](WinFsp-as-an-IPC-Mechanism) document offers insights into the WinFsp Inter-Process Communication mechanism.
- The [Queued Events](Queued-Events) document discusses a low-level synchronization primitive that is largely responsible for the excellent performance of the WinFsp IPC mechanism.
- The [Service Architecture](WinFsp-Service-Architecture) document discusses how to intergrate a file system into Windows as a service and the reasons to do so.
- The [SSHFS Port Case Study](SSHFS-Port-Case-Study) document chronicles the creation of the WinFsp-FUSE compatibility layer and the decisions that led to its design.

## Testing

- The [Testing](WinFsp-Testing) document discusses the WinFsp testing strategy and how WinFsp achieves correctness and stability.
- The [Performance](WinFsp-Performance-Testing) document compares WinFsp performance against other file systems.

## Compatibility

- The [Compatibility](NTFS-Compatibility) document discusses current WinFsp compatibility with NTFS.

WinFsp is available under the GPLv3 license with a special exception for Free/Libre and Open Source Software.
